DataOps Copilot brings Snowflake, Databricks, and Airflow into one operational cockpit inside VS Code, then layers Gemini intelligence on top for optimization, observability, and decision support.

## 🖼️ Hero Section

Data teams do not need another isolated query runner. They need one control surface for execution, monitoring, orchestration, and AI-guided improvements.

DataOps Copilot is built for that exact workflow.

## 🧠 What is DataOps Copilot?

DataOps Copilot is a production-grade VS Code extension designed for engineers who operate data platforms, not just write SQL.

It solves three common pain points:

- Tool fragmentation across Snowflake, Databricks, and Airflow.
- Lack of proactive insight before query/resource mistakes happen.
- Slow context switching between execution and observability.

Unlike standard platform-specific extensions, DataOps Copilot combines:

- Multi-platform control in one sidebar.
- AI-guided optimization and advisories.
- Operational actions (for example: trigger Airflow DAG runs) directly from context.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project is Different (USP)

### 1. Intelligence over pure execution

Most tools stop at "run command". DataOps Copilot adds analysis before and after execution.

### 2. AI-driven insights built into operations

Optimization, risk prediction, and advisory outcomes are part of the normal workflow, not an afterthought.

### 3. Observability + optimization in one loop

You can inspect platform health, run workload actions, and apply AI recommendations without leaving VS Code.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikh9123/DataOps-Copilot.git
cd DataOps-Copilot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build

```bash
npm run compile
```

### 4. Launch extension host

- Open the project in VS Code.
- Press F5.

### 5. Create VSIX package (for direct use)
